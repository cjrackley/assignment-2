            <h3>Extra Food Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Some restaurants on Tate Street accept Flex and offer student discounts</li>
                <li> If late night runs to Manhattan Subs doesn't appeal to you, UNCG offers a 24 hour self-serve food and drink station</li>
                <li> Restaurant's aren't for everyone, so for those who prefer to make food at home, UNCG has their very own general-store!</li>
